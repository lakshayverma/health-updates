Based on the treatment plan provided to us, the estimated cost is average going to be **₹25 Lakhs**. But this is a rough estimate and the actual cost can vary based on the treatment response and the duration of treatment.


The cost is not being spent in one go but is required to be submitted as and when the treatment progresses. The cost is broken down as follows:

1. **Salvage Therapy**: The cost of just the Salvage Therapy is about coming to about **₹14-₹16 Lakhs**.
   - Chemotherapy cycles
   - Immunotherapy Drugs
   - Hospitalization
   - Medications
   - Follow-up visits and Procedures
2. **Bone Marrow Transplant**: The cost of Bone Marrow Transplant is about **₹10-₹12 Lakhs**.
   - High dose chemotherapy

   - Stem Cell Collection
   - Hospitalization
